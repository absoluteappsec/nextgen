## ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

Perform a comprehensive code analysis to extract the above information. Focus on security-critical aspects of the application. Your analysis should include:

1. **Code Inspection**: Analyze source code, comments, and documentation
2. **Configuration Review**: Examine configuration files, environment settings
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Review third-party libraries and components
4. **Data Flow Mapping**: Trace how data moves through the application
5. **Security Control Identification**: Document security mechanisms
6. **Vulnerability Pattern Recognition**: Identify code patterns that could lead to vulnerabilities

Compile your findings into a detailed security-focused report organized according to the sections above. For each identified risk or security concern, provide specific code references and concrete recommendations for remediation.
